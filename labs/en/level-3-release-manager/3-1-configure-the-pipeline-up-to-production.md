# Lab 3.1 - Configure the CI/CD pipeline up to production

**Level**: 3 Release Manager

**Time**: ~75 min

**You will**: turn a two-stage pipeline into a four-stage one that reaches production, give every
stage its org and a credential a real project can live with, and publish all of it the way every
change reaches a major branch: through a Pull Request.

## The situation

Open the **DevOps Pipeline** panel and look at what Victor left.

![The DevOps Pipeline panel with integration and uat only](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/devops-pipeline--one-column.png)

`integration` **(1)** and `uat`, each with its org **(2)**, and the feature branches your teammates
have in flight. Work reaches the business testers, and then it stops. There is no `preprod`, and
`main`, production, is a branch nothing deploys: every release so far reached production by hand,
which is exactly the kind of release nobody can say anything about afterwards.

And the two stages that do exist reach their orgs through a shortcut. The CI logs into
`helios-integration` and `helios-uat` with `SFDX_AUTH_URL_INTEGRATION` and `SFDX_AUTH_URL_UAT`, two
secrets holding long-lived OAuth refresh tokens. Level 1 told you they were an exception for
throwaway scratch orgs. Three things are wrong with them on a real project, and somebody will ask
you why you are spending an hour on this:

1. **They cannot be rotated.** Changing one means authenticating again, as a human, in a browser
2. **They are bearer credentials with no scope.** Whoever reads the secret has everything that user
   has, from anywhere, until it is revoked
3. **They are tied to a person.** When that person leaves or their token is reset, the pipeline
   stops, and nobody knows why

The alternative is a **JWT flow through an External Client App**: a certificate you hold, a
pre-authorised user, no password anywhere, and revocation by deleting one app. sfdx-hardis sets it
up for you, org by org, and writes the branch configuration while it is at it.

That is your first week. None of it is unusual: most projects start with the stages they need on day
one, and finishing the pipeline waits until the day somebody needs to release properly.

## Before you start

- [ ] Levels 1 and 2 finished
- [ ] `helios-prod` still connected in **Orgs Manager**. It is the Developer Edition org you signed
      up for in Level 1, and the Dev Hub of your scratch orgs. From this lab on, it is also
      production
- [ ] One more free Developer Edition org, signed up at
      [developer.salesforce.com/signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) exactly like the
      first one, and connected in **Orgs Manager** with the alias `helios-preprod`
- [ ] Both seeded: Welcome page > **Training: Level 3** > **Set up one of my training orgs**, once
      for `helios-preprod` and once for `helios-prod`
- [ ] `helios-integration` and `helios-uat` connected in **Orgs Manager**, as since Level 1
- [ ] On `integration` in VS Code, with nothing waiting in the **Source Control** panel

!!! note "The CI, not your workstation"
    Your own connection to these orgs already exists and is not changing: Orgs Manager keeps
    working exactly as before. What you set up here is how a **GitHub runner**, which is not you and
    has no browser, reaches each org.

## Steps

### 1. Decide the shape

Four questions, and their answers are the whole pipeline:

| Question                                                                     | Helios answer                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Which branches are **major**, meaning they have an org and a deployment job? | `integration`, `uat`, `preprod`, `main`                                                  |
| Which branch can merge into which?                                           | `integration` into `uat`, `uat` into `preprod`, `preprod` into `main`. Nothing skips one |
| Which branch is production?                                                  | `main`                                                                                   |
| Where does an urgent fix start?                                              | From `preprod`, so it never carries the work still waiting in `integration` and `uat`    |

If you cannot state them in one sentence each, configuring them will not help.

`preprod` earns its place in two ways. It is the last rehearsal before production, an org that holds
what production holds and that nobody works in, so a release that deploys there cleanly has very few
surprises left. And it is where hotfixes start, which Lab 3.7 is about.

The order of this lab follows from one rule: **a branch has to exist before an org can be attached
to it**. So the branches come first, then their protection, then their orgs.

### 2. Create the preprod branch

`main` already exists: it is the default branch of every fork. `preprod` does not, and it starts
from `main`, because it holds what production holds.

In your fork (your own copy of the course repository on GitHub, for example
`github.com/my-username/sfdx-hardis-training`), click the branch count next to the branch selector,
or open `github.com/my-username/sfdx-hardis-training/branches`. Click **New branch** **(1)**, type
`preprod` as the name **(2)**, pick `main` as the source **(3)**, and **Create new branch**.

![The New branch dialog of GitHub, creating preprod from main](../../_assets/annotated/web/github-new-branch.png)

Then tell VS Code: in the **Source Control** panel, **...** menu, **Pull, Push** > **Fetch**. The
next steps list the branches of your fork, and a branch VS Code has not fetched is not in the list.

### 3. Protect preprod and main

From now on, **nobody pushes to a major branch**: not a contributor, not you. Every change reaches
`integration`, `uat`, `preprod` and `main` through a Pull Request whose checks are green, and GitHub
enforces it rather than trusting everybody to remember. Since Lab 1.2, `integration` and `uat`
work that way: setting up the environment protected them. `preprod` and `main` are yours to
protect, and a release manager does it the day the branches join the pipeline, not after the first
bad merge.

In your fork (`github.com/my-username/sfdx-hardis-training`), click **Settings** **(1)**, then
**Branches** **(2)** in the left menu. The two rules **(4)** are the ones setting up your environment
created in Lab 1.2. Click **Add rule** **(3)**.

![The Branches settings of a fork, with the Add rule button and the two existing rules](../../_assets/annotated/web/github-branch-rules.png)

The form is long, and five things on it matter. The picture is the `integration` rule, opened from
the list above, so it shows the values you are about to set:

![A branch protection rule requiring a Pull Request and two status checks, with no bypass](../../_assets/annotated/web/github-branch-rule.png)

1. **Branch name pattern** **(1)**: `preprod`
2. Tick **Require a pull request before merging** **(2)**, and untick **Require approvals** under
   it: you work alone here, and GitHub never lets you approve your own Pull Request. On a real
   project, ask for one approval
3. Tick **Require status checks to pass before merging** **(3)**. A search box appears under it.
   Type `Simulate` and pick **Simulate Deployment to Major Org**, then type `Mega` and pick
   **Mega-Linter**. Both land in **Status checks that are required**: they are the two checks every
   Pull Request of this course runs
4. Tick **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** **(4)**. Without it, the owner of the
   repository, you, still gets a checkbox to push or merge anyway
5. Click **Create** at the bottom. On an existing rule the same button reads **Save changes**
   **(5)**

Then **Add rule** again, for `main`, with the same settings. Back on the list: four rules,
`integration`, `uat`, `preprod` and `main`.

The search box only suggests checks that ran on this repository in the last seven days. Both ran on
your Level 2 Pull Requests, so they are there unless you took a long break: in that case open any
Pull Request into `integration` first, and its checks put them back in the list.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: what the rule enforces</summary>

A required check is matched by **its job name**, not by the workflow file. `Simulate Deployment to
Major Org` is the job of `.github/workflows/check-deploy.yml`, which runs on every Pull Request into
the four major branches. `Mega-Linter` is the job of `.github/workflows/megalinter.yml`, which runs
on every push, so on the last commit of every Pull Request opened from a branch of your fork.

A workflow that only runs when some files change, like `link-check.yml` here, must never be
required: a Pull Request that does not touch those files waits for it forever, and GitHub shows it
as **Expected**, never as failed.

The same rule, set through the GitHub API, is what **Set up my training environment** did for
`integration` and `uat`:

    gh api -X PUT repos/<your-handle>/sfdx-hardis-training/branches/preprod/protection \
      -F "required_pull_request_reviews[required_approving_review_count]=0" \
      -f "required_status_checks[contexts][]=Simulate Deployment to Major Org" \
      -f "required_status_checks[contexts][]=Mega-Linter" \
      -F "required_status_checks[strict]=false" -F enforce_admins=true -F restrictions=null

`strict=false` is a choice: `true` would also require every Pull Request to be up to date with its
target before merging, which on a busy `integration` means updating every open branch after every
merge. GitLab, Azure DevOps and Bitbucket have the same settings under other names: protected
branches, branch policies, merge checks.

</details>

### 4. Configure integration and its org: Add/Configure Org

Now the orgs. One command does it all for a branch: it writes the branch configuration, the org it
deploys to and the branch it merges into, creates the credential the CI logs in with, and deploys the
External Client App into the org. You run it once per major branch, starting with `integration`.

In the **DevOps Pipeline** panel, click the gear **(1)** at the top right and choose
**Add/Configure Org** **(2)**.

![The gear menu of the DevOps Pipeline panel, open on Add/Configure Org](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-settings-menu--add-org.png)

The command runs in a panel and asks one question at a time **(1)**, with the answers to click below
it **(2)**. Here it is at the second question, with `helios-integration` already chosen.

![The Add/Configure Org command asking which git branch to configure](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/configure-auth-branch--branch-question.png)

It asks a dozen questions, in this order:

1. **Please select or login into the org you want to configure the SF CLI Authentication** -
   `helios-integration`. The command makes it your default org and, because that changed, VS Code
   starts the same command again. Pick `helios-integration` a second time in the new panel and carry
   on from there
2. **What is the name of the git branch you want to configure Automated CI/CD deployments from?** -
   `integration`. The list is built from the branches of your fork, and branches whose name contains
   a `/` are left out, which is why no feature branch is offered
3. **What is the base URL or domain or the org you want to connect to, as integration related
   org ?** Pick **🧪 Sandbox or Scratch org (test.salesforce.com)**: `helios-integration` is a
   scratch org, and a scratch org logs in like a sandbox. The highlighted answer is the one above
   it, **📝 Custom login URL**, so read this list rather than pressing Enter
4. **What are the target git branches that integration will be able to merge in?** - `uat`. This is
   the merge path of step 1, written as `mergeTargets`
5. **What is the Salesforce username that will be used for deployments by CI server ?** - the
   `helios-integration` username, which it offers you already filled in
6. **How do you want to provide the SSL certificate?** - **Generate a self-signed certificate
   (default)**. The other answer, CA-signed, generates nothing and only prints instructions
7. **Do you want sfdx-hardis to configure the SF CLI External Client App or Connected App on your
   org ?** - yes
8. **Which JWT certificate storage mode do you want?** - **ClientId + decryption key as secret
   variables + encrypted certificate as file (default)**. The other mode puts the certificate itself
   in a third secret and deletes the file
9. **Please confirm when variables have been set.** This one is a stop, and step 5 is what it is
   waiting for. Do not click **Validate** yet
10. Then, after you confirm: the **name** of the External Client App, a **contact email**, and the
    **profile to pre-authorise** (`System Administrator`). The list shows the profile names in the
    language of the org's user, so an org set to French lists `Administrateur système` instead

### 5. Store the two secrets, then let the command finish

Just above question 9 the panel prints the two values the CI needs **(2)**, each with a copy button.
Nothing prints them again, so do not close the panel. The panel keeps every question you answered
**(1)**, and the files it wrote are in the reports bar at the bottom **(3)**.

![The Add/Configure Org command printing the two secrets and waiting for them to be stored](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/configure-auth-variables--secrets.png)

In your fork (`github.com/my-username/sfdx-hardis-training`): **Settings > Secrets and variables >
Actions > New repository secret**, twice:

| Name                          | Value                                |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `SFDX_CLIENT_ID_INTEGRATION`  | the consumer key the command printed |
| `SFDX_CLIENT_KEY_INTEGRATION` | the passphrase the command printed   |

The suffix is **the branch name in upper case**. That is the whole convention, and it is why the
names are not arbitrary.

!!! note "The orange warning about your pipeline YAML"
    Under the two values, the panel warns that on GitHub a secret also has to be passed to the job
    in `.github/workflows/*.yml`. It is right, and it is the step people forget: a secret GitHub
    holds and the workflow never reads is a secret the job does not have. This course's workflows
    already pass all eight, `SFDX_CLIENT_ID_*` and `SFDX_CLIENT_KEY_*`, for the four branches. Open
    `.github/workflows/process-deploy.yml` and read its `env:` block once, because on your own
    project that block is yours to write.

Now click **Validate** on question 9, answer the last three questions, and let the command create
the app.

What it wrote, and where:

| What                              | Where                                                                   | What it is                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Branch configuration              | `config/branches/.sfdx-hardis.integration.yml`                          | `targetUsername`, `instanceUrl` and `mergeTargets`             |
| An encrypted private key          | `config/branches/.jwt/integration.key`                                  | The credential itself, meant to be committed                   |
| A certificate                     | `integration.crt` in your home directory, deleted after the app deploys | What is uploaded into the org                                  |
| An External Client App definition | deployed into the org by the command                                    | What Salesforce authenticates against                          |
| Two values to store as secrets    | printed in the command panel                                            | `SFDX_CLIENT_ID_INTEGRATION` and `SFDX_CLIENT_KEY_INTEGRATION` |

The private key is **encrypted**, with a passphrase the command generates at random and that only
your secret holds. The repository alone is not enough to authenticate, which is what makes
committing the key acceptable.

### 6. Check the authorisation it did for you

The step everybody warns you about, pre-authorising the app, is the one the command already did:
the External Client App it deploys carries `Admin approved users are pre-authorized` and the profile
you named at the last question. Look at it once, so you know where it is when it matters.

In `helios-integration`: **Setup > External Client App Manager**, open the app, whose name defaulted
to `sfdxhardisintegration`, then **Policies**. Permitted Users reads *Admin approved users are
pre-authorized*, and the profile is listed.

It matters because of the one path where it is **not** done for you: if the app deployment fails and
the command falls back to printing manual instructions, those instructions stop at uploading the
certificate. Follow them literally and the first CI login fails with `user hasn't approved this
consumer`, an accurate message that reads like a bug.

### 7. The same for uat, preprod and main

Same gear, **Add/Configure Org**, three more times, one per branch and its org:

| Branch    | Org                  | Base URL answer                                                           | Merges into  | Secrets                                           |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `uat`     | `helios-uat`         | **🧪 Sandbox or Scratch org (test.salesforce.com)**                       | `preprod`    | `SFDX_CLIENT_ID_UAT`, `SFDX_CLIENT_KEY_UAT`         |
| `preprod` | `helios-preprod`     | **☢️ Other: Dev org, Production org or DevHub org (login.salesforce.com)** | `main`       | `SFDX_CLIENT_ID_PREPROD`, `SFDX_CLIENT_KEY_PREPROD` |
| `main`    | `helios-prod`        | **☢️ Other: Dev org, Production org or DevHub org (login.salesforce.com)** | tick nothing | `SFDX_CLIENT_ID_MAIN`, `SFDX_CLIENT_KEY_MAIN`       |

Check the org twice for `main`: pointing production at the wrong org is the single most expensive
mistake available in this lab. `preprod` and `main` are Developer Edition orgs, which log in the way
production does, and only scratch orgs and sandboxes use `test.salesforce.com`.

Eight secrets, four External Client Apps, four keys. Tedious once, then never again.

### 8. Let contributors start a hotfix

Contributors choose where a User Story goes from a list, and `preprod` is not in it yet.

Open the **DevOps Pipeline** panel, the gear menu, **Pipeline Settings**. The page title reads
**Global Pipeline Settings**, and the scope selector **(1)** reads **Global Settings**.

![The Global Pipeline Settings screen, with the scope selector, the Edit button and the User Stories tab](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-config--target-branches.png)

Click **Edit** **(2)**, then the **User Stories** tab **(3)**. Two fields matter, and they are **two
separate text boxes, one value per line**: **Available PR/MR target branches** and **Labels for
available PR/MR target branches**. Nothing pairs them except their order, so line 2 of one belongs
to line 2 of the other.

| Line | Branch      | Label                                                                 |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | integration | `The shared integration org, where every contributor merges`          |
| 2    | preprod     | `Hotfixes on the production version, agreed with the release manager` |

`uat` and `main` are not in that list, on purpose. Nobody builds a User Story against them: work
reaches `uat` by promotion from `integration`, and `main` by promotion from `preprod`.

**Save**.

!!! note "Looking for the production branch?"
    `productionBranch` has no field in the settings panel, and this project already carries it:
    `productionBranch: main`, in the Pipeline block of `config/.sfdx-hardis.yml`. A panel that
    covers most of a configuration and not all of it is normal, and it is why the under the hood
    sections of this course keep showing you the file.

### 9. Tell the panel what the project now uses

`config/.sfdx-hardis.yml` carries `orgAuthenticationMode: secretsOnly`, put there when the course
handed you the auth URL shortcut. It tells the DevOps Pipeline panel not to look for certificate key
files, and not to warn you when there are none. There are keys now, so that line is a lie, and a
panel told a lie stops being able to warn you.

Still in **Pipeline Settings**, scope **Global Settings** **(1)**, open the **Deployment** tab
**(2)**.

![The Global Pipeline Settings panel, Deployment tab](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/pipeline-config-deployment--deployment-tab.png)

**Org Authentication Mode** **(3)** reads *CI/CD secrets variables only*. Click **Edit** **(4)**,
change it to *Encrypted certificate key files*, and **Save**. From now on the panel checks
`config/branches/.jwt/<branch>.key` for every major branch and says so when one is missing.

### 10. Delete the shortcut, before anything proves anything

In your fork (`github.com/my-username/sfdx-hardis-training`): **Settings > Secrets and variables >
Actions**, find `SFDX_AUTH_URL_INTEGRATION` and `SFDX_AUTH_URL_UAT`, and delete both.

Do it now, before you publish. The authentication step of every job looks for
`SFDX_AUTH_URL_<BRANCH>` first and stops there when it finds one. While the two secrets exist, a
green job proves nothing about your keys: it logged in the old way. Once they are gone, the only way
in is the JWT one, so the next green job is the proof.

### 11. Publish the configuration through a Pull Request

Everything you did is files on your disk, on `integration`: the four branch files, the four keys,
the target branches and the authentication mode. They reach `integration` the way every change
does, through a Pull Request with green checks. The protection of step 3 would refuse anything else.

Welcome page > **Training: Level 3** > **Publish my pipeline configuration**.

![The Level 3 training menu on the Welcome page](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/welcome-custom-menu-3.png)

It lists the configuration files you changed, and leaves out anything that is not configuration.
Confirm, and it puts them on a branch of their own, `config/pipeline-<date>`, pushes it, opens the
Pull Request into `integration`, and brings VS Code back to `integration`.

Open the Pull Request in your fork. Its **Simulate Deployment to Major Org** check logs into
`helios-integration` with no auth URL secret left to use: open it from **Checks**, expand **Login &
Process Deployment**, and look for `sf org login jwt`. That line and a green check are your key
working.

When both checks are green, merge with **Merge pull request**, not with a squash: this is not a
feature, and the configuration has to travel to `uat`, `preprod` and `main` with the promotions,
commit for commit (Lab 1.6). Then **Pull** in the **Source Control** panel: your `integration` gets
the configuration back, merged.

`uat`, `preprod` and `main` prove their keys the first time a Pull Request goes into them: the
promotion to `uat` in Lab 3.5, then `preprod` and `main` in Lab 3.6.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: what the JWT flow actually does</summary>

The command ran:

    sf hardis:project:configure:auth

and every CI job now runs, before anything else:

    sf org login jwt \
      --client-id $SFDX_CLIENT_ID_INTEGRATION \
      --jwt-key-file <decrypted key> \
      --username <targetUsername from the branch config> \
      --instance-url <instanceUrl from the branch config> \
      --alias integration

The private key is decrypted at the start of the job with `SFDX_CLIENT_KEY_INTEGRATION`, used, and
never written anywhere persistent.

**How the authentication hook chooses.** For a branch `<B>`, it looks for `SFDX_AUTH_URL_<B>` first,
in that spelling and then upper-cased. If it finds one, it uses it and returns, before the JWT
variables are even read. Only if there is none does it go on to `SFDX_CLIENT_ID_<B>` plus the key.
That order is why step 10 comes before publishing.

The JWT lookup also accepts a plain `SFDX_CLIENT_ID` with no suffix, as a last resort and with a
warning in the log: a single unsuffixed secret left over from an old setup answers for every branch.

`orgAuthenticationMode` is **not** written by this command, and no CLI command reads it. It only
tells the VS Code pipeline panel which shape to expect: `secretsOnly` means the credentials live
entirely in CI secrets, `encryptedCert`, the default, means every major branch has a key committed.

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Under the hood: the files you just published</summary>

`config/.sfdx-hardis.yml` gained:

    availableTargetBranches:
      - integration
      - preprod
    availableTargetBranchesLabels:
      - "The shared integration org, where every contributor merges"
      - "Hotfixes on the production version, agreed with the release manager"
    orgAuthenticationMode: encryptedCert

and `config/branches/` now holds four files, each with `targetUsername`, `instanceUrl` and
`mergeTargets`, plus a `.jwt` folder with four encrypted keys.

**A major branch is not declared anywhere as "major".** It becomes one by having a branch
configuration file with an org in it. That is the whole mechanism, and knowing it means you can read
any sfdx-hardis project in two minutes by listing `config/branches/`. Every screen that reads major
branches, the pipeline diagram and the scope selector of Pipeline Settings included, is reading that
folder.

`sf hardis:project:create` would have generated the skeleton of a new project: the workflows for
every git provider, `.mega-linter.yml`, `projectName`, `developmentBranch` and `autoCleanTypes`. It
writes no `config/branches/` file and asks for no org but the Dev Hub: the branch files are
Add/Configure Org's job, as above. The command that takes an existing org with no repository at all
and produces the first commit is `sf hardis:org:retrieve:sources:dx`, the real starting point of
most projects.

### 12. Look at the diagram again

Open the **DevOps Pipeline** panel and click **Refresh**. This is the pipeline you built:

![The DevOps Pipeline panel with four major branches, each deploying to its org](../../_assets/annotated/vscode/devops-pipeline-level3--four-stages.png)

1. **`integration`** **(1)**, where contributors merge, with the promotion arrow leaving it
2. **`uat`** **(2)**, where the business signs off
3. **`preprod`** **(3)**, the rehearsal of production, and where hotfixes start
4. **`main`** **(4)**, production
5. The four orgs **(5)**, one per branch, in the order the work travels through them

That diagram is now the truth about this project, and the thing you point at when a stakeholder asks
"so where is it". The **+ PR** buttons on the arrows are the promotion Pull Requests, and Lab 3.5 is
the first time you click one.

## What you should see

- Four branch protection rules in **Settings** > **Branches** of your fork, `integration`, `uat`,
  `preprod` and `main`, each requiring a Pull Request and the two checks
- `config/branches/` on `integration` holding four files and four `.jwt/*.key` files
- Eight secrets in your fork, none of them an auth URL
- Your configuration Pull Request merged into `integration`, with `sf org login jwt` in the log of
  its check
- The DevOps Pipeline panel with four columns and no warning about a missing key

## If it goes wrong

**preprod is not in the branch list of Add/Configure Org.**
VS Code has not fetched it. **Source Control** panel, **...** menu, **Pull, Push** > **Fetch**, then
run the command again.

**The preprod column appears with no org.**
The branch file was written for another branch name. Check `config/branches/` for a typo: the file
name has to match the branch exactly.

**`user hasn't approved this consumer`.**
Step 6: the External Client App exists but the user is not pre-authorised.

**`invalid_grant: audience is invalid`.**
The instance URL does not match the org type: `https://test.salesforce.com` for a scratch org,
`https://login.salesforce.com` for a Developer Edition org. Check the branch file of the job that
failed.

**The job cannot decrypt the key.**
`SFDX_CLIENT_KEY_<BRANCH>` is wrong or was copied with a trailing newline. Recreate it.

**`client identifier invalid`.**
The External Client App behind that consumer key was never created: the command stopped after it
printed the two values. Run **Add/Configure Org** again for that branch, store the two new values,
and publish again.

**Everything passes even with the JWT secrets missing.**
An auth URL secret is still there and still winning. Step 10.

**Publish my pipeline configuration says the branch could not be created.**
A configuration file you changed was also changed on GitHub. Pull in the **Source Control** panel,
then run it again.

**The check you want to require is not suggested.**
GitHub only lists checks that reported on this repository in the last seven days. Open a Pull
Request into `integration`, let its checks run, and come back to the rule.

**Set up one of my training orgs fails on `helios-prod`.**
The usual cause is an expired connection: reconnect it in **Orgs Manager** under the same alias, and
run it again.
