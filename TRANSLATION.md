# Translating the course

The course ships in **English** and in **French**. `labs/en/` is the reference and every other
locale is a mirror of it.

## English is the reference, always

This is the one rule the rest of the page follows from.

- **Every change starts in `labs/en/`.** A lab is written, corrected or renamed in English first,
  and the translations follow. There is no such thing as a fix that lives only in French
- **A translation is never the source of a fact.** When the two disagree about what a button does,
  English is right and the translation is behind. Fix the translation, or fix English first and then
  the translation, but never the other way round
- **The structure is English.** File names, folders, front matter keys, `id`, `level`, `lab`,
  `screenshots` and `depends_on` are identical in every locale, and the URLs are the English slugs.
  Only the prose, the titles and the descriptions are translated
- **A translation may lag, and that is not a failure.** `source_rev` says which version of the
  English page a translation was made from, and `scripts/i18n/check-translations.mjs` lists the ones
  the source has moved past. That list is what to re-read, not a broken build

## What to translate

| Path                     | Translate                                                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `labs/en/**/*.md`        | **Yes.** Copy to `labs/<locale>/`, same file names, and translate              |
| `labs/_assets/**`        | No. Screenshots are shared across locales, in English                          |
| `labs/_snippets/**`      | No. Command blocks, included by reference                                      |
| `training-universe.json` | No. Org aliases, branch names, User Story ids and character names never change |
| `BACKLOG.md`             | No. Generated                                                                  |
| `labs/link-map.*.md`     | No. Generated, one per locale                                                  |

## The tools stay in English

The course assumes the learner runs **sfdx-hardis, its VS Code extension and their Salesforce orgs
in English**, because every screenshot was taken that way. So in a translated lab:

- **Anything you click keeps its English name**, in bold as in the source: **Setup**,
  **Orgs Manager**, **Save / Publish**, **Recent Changes**, **Merging is blocked**. The sentence
  around it is translated, the label is not
- **The prompts and the log lines quoted from a command stay verbatim.** They are what the reader
  sees on screen
- **The concepts are translated**, with the French Salesforce vocabulary where there is one:
  *présentation de page* for the concept, **Page Layouts** for the menu entry
- Say so once, near the top of the locale's home page, so nobody wonders why the buttons are in
  another language

A learner who sets `SFDX_HARDIS_LANG` gets a CLI in their own language and lab text that no longer
matches the labels. That is their choice to make, and the course does not suggest it.

## How to add a locale

1. `cp -r labs/en labs/<locale>`
2. Translate every `.md` file, keeping the front matter keys, the file names, the `**(1)**` pill
   references and the image paths
3. In each translated file, set `lang: <locale>`
4. Declare the locale in the three places that need a word in it:
   - `TROUBLESHOOTING` in `scripts/build/site.mjs`, the translated "If it goes wrong" heading, which
     is how that section gets folded on the site
   - `LOCALES` in `scripts/build/lab-crossrefs.mjs`, the word for "step", which is how
     "Lab 2.7, étape 3" becomes a link to that heading
   - `NAV_LABELS` and `LOCALE_NAMES` in `scripts/build/universe.mjs`, the half-dozen words the
     navigation and the link map need
5. `node scripts/build/lab-crossrefs.mjs`, which links every mention of another lab
6. Commit the English side first if you changed it, then
   `node scripts/i18n/stamp-source-rev.mjs <locale>`, which writes each `source_rev` from git
7. `node scripts/build/universe.mjs`, then `node scripts/build/site.mjs`
8. Add the locale to the `nav` and to `extra.alternate` in `course-site.yml`, and a banner in
   `site-overrides/main.html`

The site already serves `/en/...`, so `/fr/...` needs no restructuring.

## Staleness

`source_rev` is what makes a translation checkable. `scripts/i18n/check-translations.mjs` lists the
translated files whose English source has moved since, and it runs in CI.

```bash
node scripts/i18n/check-translations.mjs          # list what is behind
node scripts/i18n/stamp-source-rev.mjs fr         # after re-reading, stamp them again
```

A translation behind its source is not an error: it is a list of what to re-read.

## What never gets translated

Org aliases, branch names, API names, User Story ids, command lines, `Helios Energy` and the
character names.

The technical and brand terms already listed in the
[sfdx-hardis translation rules](https://github.com/hardisgroupcom/sfdx-hardis/blob/main/.claude/rules/translations.md):
Salesforce, SFDMU, Git, GitHub, GitLab, VS Code, Cloudity, Apex, LWC, sfdx-hardis, merge, commit,
branch, sandbox, scratch org, package.xml. "org" stays "org" in every language.

**"Lab N.M" is an identifier, not a word.** It is the same in every locale, because it names a page
whose URL and whose entry in the Training menu are the same everywhere. What changes around it is
the word for a step: "Lab 2.7 step 3" in English, "Lab 2.7, étape 3" in French, and
`scripts/build/lab-crossrefs.mjs` knows both.

## French

Beyond the rules above:

- Official Salesforce French where there is one: *ensemble d'autorisations* exists, but Salesforce
  developers in France say **permission set**, and this course follows the developers. *Flux*,
  *Champ*, *Objet*, *Profil*, *Type d'enregistrement*, *Règle de validation* are used as concepts
- Developer terms stay English: flag, merge, commit, branch, fork, scratch org, sandbox, pipeline,
  Pull Request, hotfix, backpromote, retrofit, deployment action, User Story
- *Dépôt* for repository, *déploiement* for deployment, *récupérer* for retrieve,
  *notes de version* for release notes, *présentation de page* for page layout
- French typography: a space before `:`, `;`, `?` and `!`, and ordinary quotes rather than guillemets
  so that the markdown stays easy to diff
- No em-dashes, the same rule the English course follows

## The Trailmixes

A Trailhead Trailmix cannot be localised. Each language is a **new Trailmix**, built from the same
step list with `/<locale>/` targets, and `labs/link-map.<locale>.md` is generated to hold those URLs.
Budget one Trailmix per language per level.

## Badge pages

Locale independent. One page per learner, whatever language they learned in.
