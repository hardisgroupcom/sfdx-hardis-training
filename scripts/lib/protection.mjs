/**
 * Branch protection on the learner's fork.
 *
 * Without it, GitHub shows a green Merge button on a Pull Request whose
 * deployment check failed, and a merge made on red deploys nothing, or deploys
 * half of it. The course teaches that a red check stops the merge, so the fork
 * enforces it rather than hoping everybody reads the check first.
 *
 * What a protected branch requires here:
 *   - every GitHub Actions check that runs on each Pull Request into a major
 *     branch has finished and succeeded
 *   - nobody bypasses it, the owner of the fork included, and nobody force
 *     pushes or deletes the branch
 *
 * No review is required: a learner works alone and cannot approve their own
 * Pull Request, so requiring one would block every merge of the course.
